This lit project creates a chess board where pieces make completely random moves on their own! No cap! 

## Live Demo 👀
Check it out: https://developerkubilay.github.io/auto-play-chess/

## What's The Deal? 💯
- ⚡ Fully automated chess gameplay
- 🎮 Pieces move randomly every 150ms 
- 🏆 Tracks wins for both black and white
- 🔊 Chess piece move sounds (click anywhere to enable)
- 📱 Responsive design that works on mobile too

## How It Works 🤔
This project uses Chess.js for game logic and Chessboard.js for the visual board. The pieces just make random legal moves until someone wins, then it starts over automatically.

## Tech Stack 💻
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- jQuery
- Chess.js
- Chessboard.js

## Fun Fact 🧠
The code actually tries to predict which side might win based on piece values!
